# Use this profile when planning the launch of a new feature or product

profileName: "feature-launch"
description: "Profile for planning new feature or product launches (greenfield features, new products, major capabilities)"

# ==========================================
# CORE PLANNER CONFIGURATION
# ==========================================

plannerType: feature_launch
domain: software

# Feature launch phases (setup → build → validate → ship)
phases:
  - requirements      # Clarify requirements, design APIs, define success metrics
  - scaffolding       # Set up project structure, dependencies, CI/CD
  - implementation    # Build core functionality, integrate with existing systems
  - testing           # Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
  - documentation     # API docs, user guides, release notes
  - rollout           # Staged rollout, monitoring, feedback collection

# ==========================================
# TECH STACK CONFIGURATION
# ==========================================
# These should be overridden by preprocessing based on actual project
# Setting Python as an example default for feature launches
